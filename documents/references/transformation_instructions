"CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: 

1) Replace ALL instances of ALEX with ARJUN, MAYA with PRIYA for Hindi (KARTHIK and MEERA for Tamil). 

2) Replace 'Future Proof with AI' with 'नई तकनीक, नए अवसर' for Hindi ('புதிய மனிதருடன் ஆழ்நோக்கம்' for Tamil).

3) DO NOT translate the intro and outro sections - use the standard localized intros and outros from the system configuration instead.

4) For Hindi and Tamil: Please try to transform all English words completely in the specified language. Use simple words that people understand. Don't use difficult/literary/formal words that people don't use in everyday conversation.

5) Make it sound like real conversation, not translation."
